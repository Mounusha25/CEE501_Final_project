# Building Energy Performance ML Pipeline - Project Description

## What We're Doing

We built a **graduate-level machine learning system** that predicts building energy performance and helps Seattle comply with Building Energy Performance Standards (BEPS).

## The Real-World Problem

Seattle requires commercial buildings to meet energy efficiency targets by **2030** and **2040**. Building owners need to know:
- Will my building comply?
- How much will retrofits cost?
- Which buildings are highest risk?

## Our Solution

A **comprehensive 26-phase ML pipeline** that:

### **1. Predicts Future Energy Use**
- Uses 2015 data to predict 2016 Energy Use Intensity (EUI)
- **Best model:** Stacking Ensemble with **R² = 0.89** (89% variance explained)
- Forecasts energy performance through 2040

### **2. Identifies High-Risk Buildings**
- Ranks buildings by compliance risk score
- Identifies top 20 buildings needing immediate action
- Classifies building trajectories (improving/worsening/stable)

### **3. Quantifies Policy Impacts**
- **2030 Forecast:** 40% of buildings need retrofits (1,200 buildings)
- **Investment needed:** \$75M - \$450M depending on retrofit depth
- **Energy savings:** Significant annual savings potential
- **Environmental impact:** Thousands of metric tons CO2e reduction

### **4. Provides Uncertainty Estimates**
- Bootstrap confidence intervals for all predictions
- 95% CI coverage: 93.5% (well-calibrated)
- Mean prediction interval: ±15 kBtu/sf

## Technical Highlights

### **Models Used**
1. **Linear Regression** (baseline)
2. **Random Forest** (tree-based ensemble)
3. **Gradient Boosting** (sequential boosting)
4. **XGBoost** (optimized gradient boosting)
5. **Stacking Ensemble** (combines all models) ← **BEST**

### **Advanced Features**
- **SHAP Analysis:** Makes models interpretable for non-experts
- **Cross-Validation:** 5-fold CV ensures robust performance
- **Residual Diagnostics:** 6 plots validate model assumptions
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** RandomizedSearchCV optimizes models (Phase 24)
- **Optimization Comparison:** Quantifies improvements from tuning (Phase 25)
- **Bootstrap CI:** Quantifies prediction uncertainty (Phase 23)

### **Feature Engineering**
- **Temporal features:** Year-over-year changes, trends
- **Physics-based features:** Energy per square foot, fuel mix
- **Interaction terms:** Building type × size, type × age
- **60+ features** engineered from raw data

### **Clustering Analysis**
- K-Means identifies **4 building archetypes**:
  1. High-performers (low EUI, high Energy Star)
  2. Moderate efficiency (average performance)
  3. Energy-intensive (large, high EUI)
  4. Underperformers (need retrofits)

## Key Results

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Best R²** | 0.89 (Stacking Ensemble) |
| **RMSE** | 22.4 kBtu/sf |
| **MAE** | 15.2 kBtu/sf |
| **Top Feature** | Prior year EUI (52% importance) |

### **Optimization Impact** NEW
- **Random Forest:** R² improved from 0.87 to 0.88 (+1.2%)
- **Gradient Boosting:** R² improved from 0.86 to 0.87 (+1.1%)
- **Best Optimized Model:** Stacking Ensemble (R²=0.89, RMSE=22.4)

### **BEPS Compliance (2030)**
- **Compliant:** 60% of buildings (1,800)
- **Need Retrofits:** 40% of buildings (1,200)
- **Retrofit Area:** 15 million sq ft
- **Investment Range:** \$75M - \$450M
- **Payback Period:** 10-18 years

### **BEPS Compliance (2040)**
- **Compliant:** 40% of buildings (1,200)
- **Need Retrofits:** 60% of buildings (1,800)
- **More stringent targets require deeper interventions**

## Graduate-Level Enhancements

We elevated this from a standard ML project to graduate-level by adding:

1. **Model Interpretability (SHAP)**
   - SHAP TreeExplainer for transparent predictions
   - Beeswarm & bar plots for stakeholder communication

2. **Robust Cross-Validation**
   - 5-fold CV with statistical reporting (mean ± std)
   - Multiple metrics (R², RMSE, MAE)

3. **Residual Analysis**
   - 6 diagnostic plots
   - Validates assumptions (normality, homoscedasticity)

4. **Policy Impact Analysis**
   - Real-world BEPS compliance forecasting
   - Economic & environmental impact quantification

5. **Uncertainty Quantification**
   - Bootstrap confidence intervals
   - 100 resamples for robust uncertainty estimates

## Why This Matters

### **For Building Owners:**
- **Proactive planning:** Know 5-10 years in advance if retrofits are needed
- **Cost estimation:** Budget for retrofits with confidence
- **Benchmark performance:** Compare against similar buildings

### **For City Planners:**
- **Policy effectiveness:** Quantify BEPS compliance forecasts
- **Resource allocation:** Identify high-risk buildings for targeted programs
- **Economic planning:** Understand retrofit investment landscape

### **For Researchers:**
- **Methodological contributions:** Ensemble + SHAP + Bootstrap CI framework
- **Reproducible science:** Complete pipeline from raw data to policy insights
- **Extensible:** Can be applied to other cities/regions
